<h1>Business Problem</h1>
A machine learning model is expected to be developed to predict customers who are likely to leave the company.
<h1>Data Story</h1>
The Telco customer churn data provides information about a fictional telecommunications company that provides home phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California during the third quarter. It indicates which customers have left the services, which have stayed, and which have signed up for the services.
